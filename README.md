This directory contains the codebase for my master's thesis.

* The **Data Prep** folder includes the folder structure and code used for general data cleaning, missing data imputation, and performing association testing.
* The **Modeling** folder contains the folder structure and code for estimating survival curves, testing differences in survival distributions between factor groups, and building both the Proportional Hazard Model and the Bayesian semiparametric Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) Model.
